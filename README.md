Minimal working example for my Note Gallery setup. 

Includes:
- Filtering by file paths, properties, and tags for categories.
- An example of subcategories (filtered by subcategories).
- Showing files with a minimum score (any number property).

Does not include (possibly to add?):
- Displaying a random set of 10 files from the current query.

Make sure to:
- Allow JavaScript execution in Meta Bind's settings.
- Keep in mind that this is essentially copy-pasted from my main vault which means, since I have bad code-writing habits, some of the code may be messy and hard to edit/generalize.
- Use the note gallery in Reading Mode.
